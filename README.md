# CardShuffle
Sample code of the card shuffle game from CS193p Stanford University's course. Fork this repo to be able to open PRs and observe changes between different states of the project shown in the Setup section below.

## Project Setup

- `final` branch contains the final updated project, you can check it out at the end when you're done with your own project and compare it to this one.

- `base` branch contains a snapshot from the code taken directly at the end of Lecture 2. You may find very minor differences there. (Again as advised by the course itself, try to write the code yourself and don't copy it from anywhere)

- `assignment-1` branch contains the `base` branch code + [assignment 1](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj16636/files/media/file/a1.pdf) solution.
After forking this repo, you can open a PR from this branch to the `base` branch to see what changed exactly.
